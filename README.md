# Car Price Prediction

 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
 
## Description

**This is an algorithm that will predict the price of a car using some parameters. These are some parameters such as fuel type, door number, wheel base, engine location, car length, width, height, etc. from which the algorithm predicts the price.**
