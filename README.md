# Car Price Prediction

 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms
 
## Description

**Car price Prediction is an algorithm that will predict the price of the car with the help of some parameter. These are the some parameters like fuel type, door number, wheel base, engine location, car length, width, height etc from which algorithm predict the price.**
